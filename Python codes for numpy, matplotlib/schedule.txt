Subjects to study
Decide the priority later and accordingly

1.Aerodynamics
2.Python programming for scientific software
3.CFD for practicality
4.Maths for physics- PDE AND ODE and COMPLEX variables
5.Mechanics of materials- help in getting structural knowldege
6.Electrical- overall base for a lot of things
7.CAD - fusion 360- needed for modelling


#it is possible to study all the seven, maths, and CAD are not too extensive. Mech may be short as well.

#Electrical is very important seeing my mid term marks.

#Exams may be shifted and even if not we will cross the bridge when we reach it.

#Compromise on maths will have drastic impact on my space science studies.

#Aerodynamics theory is cool and needed in the core aspect.

#CFD seems good after aerodynamic theory, intense knwoleddge required, may go hand in hand.

#CAD and CFD provide semi practical knowledge.

#For designing , at present , for aircraft what is needed is Aerodynamics, CFD, CAD, Structural mechanics.

#For research too the above theroetical aspects are very important.

#For rocket and circuitry and embedded systems, maths and electronics is very important.

#This list is highly temporary and will change soon but the knowldege would be highly substancial throughout.
